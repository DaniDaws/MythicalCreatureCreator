# Mythical Creature Generator

This project is a **Mythical Creature Generator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate a random mythical creature by specifying a species. The generated creature is a combination of random appearances, abilities, and origins.

## Features

- **Random Creature Generation**: Each generated creature has a unique combination of appearance, ability, and origin.
- **User Input**: Users can input a species name (e.g., "lion", "tiger", "phoenix") to customize the generated creature.
- **Input Validation**: The input field accepts only letters and spaces, ensuring that the species name is valid.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: After generating a creature, the input field is cleared, ready for the next input.
